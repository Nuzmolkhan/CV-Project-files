# CV-Project-files

Introduction: 
This project is based on static CV making using HTML & CSS only. here i included two pictures on header-background and profile picture. I'm sorry that due to my first
project i couldn't decorate my codes perfectly. I missed commenting also. I'll focus this next time.

Project description:
Html: In html file containing a container and under these container the full CV is included. CV has devided into three sections: header, main, footer. Header section
has the heading part and the main part contains several types of sections for including personal informations, work experiences, skills, educational info, references
and so on.
Css: styling all the components by selecting elements by class. Class is very useful in case of selecting multiple elements and styling those in one code. This helps
to code reusability and save time.

Learning things: 
This project inspired me to make more learn about CSS styling. Specially layouting & designing perform greatly enjoyable and make me more comfort on learning CSS. 
This project helps me to exploring new things and doing more creative things.
